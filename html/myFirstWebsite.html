        <p>EHOME E-sports club was formed in March 2004. In 2007, EHOME's DotA division was formed as they took HTML under their tag. EHOME was first known internationally in 2008 during the Asian Championship Games in Singapore, winning the championship with a star-studded roster comprising of legends 2009, Snoy, LongDD, GK, and DC.</p>

    <h3>Period of Instability</h3>
    <p>However, 2009 soon went inactive due to his studies and conflict with the management; LongDD departed shortly after. LongDD then joined CaNt, initiating a swap of players between the two teams. 820 and 357 were picked up from CaNt to fill the two empty spots on EHOME's roster.</p>

    <p>Despite finally establishing a stable lineup, EHOME wasn't able to replicate their results. Constant disappointments led to DC's departure and Snoy's retirement. Subsequently, two players were signed, namely Dai and Ronaldo, who were relatively unknown at the time. However, both were well-known as players from another Chinese MOBA, and high expectations were placed onto them in DotA. Despite these new additions, EHOME continued to perform badly, and Ronaldo was soon out. At the same time, 7L disbanded and their support DGC joined EHOME.</p>

    <h3>The Golden Era</h3>

    <p>KingJ and BurNIng, two of the biggest names in DotA at the time, eventually found their way into EHOME. They were heavily criticized as LGD, led by former member 2009, was performing extremely well. With ESWC Qualifiers coming up, EHOME decided to make a change; most notably, their captain and longtime carry 820 was switched to support. Being an underdog to qualify for the ESWC, EHOME surprisingly showed solid team play, defeating PIS's Shadow Fiend in a game against CityHunter with a comeback. Afterwards, they faced the highly favored LGD, pulling off a surprise win to qualify for ESWC.</p>

    <p>At ESWC in Paris, EHOME showed an invincible aura, crushing any teams in their way as they went undefeated and won the ESWC. After ESWC, EHOME won several other competitions. During ESTC, EHOME reached the finals, but was unable to defeat Nirvana.my as Mushi's Puck took the limelight. They were then favored to win the first edition of the World DotA Championship. However, they were surprised by DTS in the group stage, with Artstyle choosing a push strategy to counter them. Despite winning the rest of their group stage games, EHOME missed out on qualifying for the next round due to time ratings, and this became one of the biggest upsets of the year.[12] SMM 2010 was announced soon after. EHOME came out with a slow start, losing to Nirvana.cn in the group stage, but recovered in the second day, winning all their matches en route to becoming the champions. For the rest of 2010, the team consistently showed the same dominant form as they did at ESWC. EHOME completed their streak of 10 championships in a calendar year by winning 2011's World Gamemaster Tournament.</p>
